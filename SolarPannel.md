Question to ask installer

**Solar Panel Selection**

**Technology Type**
**a. Mono PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell)**
- Efficiency: ~20% to 22%

**b. TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact)**
- Efficiency: ~22% to 25% (Higher than PERC).

Mono PERC efficiency drops slightly more than TOPCon when the temperature hits 45°C in the summer.
Most top brands like Adani, Tata, and Waaree have now shifted their premium lines to TOPCon

**a. Panel Type**
_Monocrystalline:_
Efficiency: Higher efficiency (18-24%) means more power from a smaller area.
Cost: Generally more expensive.
Performance: Better performance in low light conditions and hot weather.
Lifespan: Longer lifespan, usually 25+ years.

_Polycrystalline:_
Efficiency: Lower efficiency (15-17%).
Cost: More affordable.
Performance: Performs well in direct sunlight but slightly less efficient in low light.
Lifespan: Similar to monocrystalline, around 20-25 years.

_Thin-Film:_
Efficiency: Lowest efficiency (10-13%).
Cost: Generally the cheapest.
Flexibility: Can be ideal for curved surfaces or less conventional installations.
Space: Requires more space for the same power output.

**b. Inverter Type:**

_String Inverters:_ Most common, connecting a series of panels. Cost-effective for simple installations.
_Microinverters:_ Installed on each panel, maximizing individual panel output. Better for shaded areas, but more expensive.
_Hybrid Inverters:_ Combine solar and battery storage management.

**C. Panel Capacity (Wattage):**

_Formula:_ Required Panel Capacity (in Watts) = (Daily kWh Consumption / Peak Sun Hours) * 1000

**D. Efficiency & Degradation**
Look for panels with an efficiency of at least 21% and a low annual degradation rate (usually around 0.5%) to ensure they last 25 years.


**Local Regulations and Incentives**

_Net Metering Policy:_ Check if Uttar Pradesh has a net metering policy, which allows you to send excess electricity back to the grid and receive credits on your bill. This is essential for maximizing savings.
_Subsidies:_ The central and state governments often offer subsidies for residential solar installations. Enquire about current schemes and eligibility criteria in Sultanpur.
_Permissions:_ You may need permits from the local municipal corporation or electricity board (e.g., Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd and Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd in UP) before installation.

For a 5kW system, the price difference for TOPCon is usually small (around ₹10,000–₹15,000 total), but the extra electricity it generates over 25 years—especially during     
UP's long summers—will pay for that difference many times over.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                               
**Important Note**: If you are applying for the PM Surya Ghar subsidy, make sure to ask your vendor for "DCR TOPCon" panels. In 2026, most top brands like Adani, Tata, and Waaree are producing these locally.
